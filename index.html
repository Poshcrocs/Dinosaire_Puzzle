        <h1>The Dinosaire Puzzle</h1>
        <p> Welcome to The Dinosaire Puzzle. <br>
            What if the meteor never struck? <br>
            What if, with patience and time, we came to coexist with our dino buddies of legend? <br>
            What if I got to the point where this was interesting, and stopped writing needless bio for what should hopefully be a fairly short mini project?  <br>
            <br>
            Like many of the good things in life, this was built on a whim. I hope it is as fun in practice as it is in concept.</p>
